# EE8230_Final_Project_Kanhchana_Ly
Final project for the course EE8230 Machine Learning for Engineers. This project evaluates and compares a number of regression models to predict the alcohol percentage in white wine, using the data set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality.

The main files include:
- README_Project.md: current file
- winequality-white.csv: the csv file of the dataset
- .ipynb: notebook containing the analysis and pipeline for the trained model

The trained model was also deployed at HugginFace at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/kanhchanaly/white_wine_regression_alcohol_prediction

The corresponding files for building the space are also provided here:
- README.md: readme file for huggingface
- app.py
- requirements.txt
- white_wine_regression_model.pkl: saved model in .pkl format
- .gitattributes
